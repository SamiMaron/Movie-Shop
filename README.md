# Movie Shop E-Commerce

This project aims to build a modern e-commerce website allowing customers to browse movies, add them to a cart, and complete a purchase. It's developed using the Spring framework for the backend and React for the frontend. The website leverages the TMDB API to browse products.


Frontend
Search Page: Allows users to search for movies/shows using a keyword or by discovering movies with genre and release year as attributes.
Search History: Records every search to the TMDB API and allows users to re-perform previous searches in a single click.
Shopping Cart: Users can add movies to a cart and view its contents, including the total cost.
Checkout Page: Users can complete their purchase by providing essential details.


Backend
REST API: Developed using Spring, facilitates frontend and backend communication.
Shopping Cart Management: Stored in user sessions using Spring session beans.
Database Connectivity: Connects to a SQL Server database to store completed orders.
